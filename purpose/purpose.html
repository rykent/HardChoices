                    This game was made to provide people with a better understanding of the struggles of low income families. We wanted to show that life is full of uncontrollable factors such as unexpected medical bills or your car breaking down and that just making good decisions sometimes isn't enough. We made this game for the non-profit LifeMoves because they provide homeless shelters and other services. They wanted a way to better spread the message of the issue and defeat stereotypes like that homeless are lazy. Hard Choices strives to provide an easy way for anybody to understand the complex issue of people falling into homelessness.
